Our project aims to mitigate the above problem by identifying cause of distraction and warning the driver if he gets distracted and thus prevent an accident from happening.


CONVOLUTION NEURAL NETWORK FOR IMAGE CLASSIFICATION:

What This Project is about?
We have a large number of 64x64 images and this project has to find out whether or  not driver is driving in safe ,moderate or unsafe zone . In this project, I applied some of the performance optimization techniques to the real-world problem of classifying images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).


Application :
This project can be used to alarm the driver when he is driving in unsafe zone for long time .
